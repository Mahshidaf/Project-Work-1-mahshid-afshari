# Project Plan

## Title
Predicting the effect of Air Pollutants in Urban Geern Spaces.

## Main Question

How do variations in the types of vegetation within urban green spaces affect the levels of specific air across different climatic zones in major cities?


## Description

This research investigates the connection between large cities' air quality and the density of urban green spaces. The aim of this study is to determine whether cities with larger green spaces have higher quality air than those with less green spaces. In order to give data-driven insights for environmental policy and urban planning, this analysis will take into account different sizes of green spaces and their effects on particular air pollutants.  Urban planning may benefit immensely from an understanding of the relationship between air quality and green space density, as it helps to clarify the role that green spaces play in environmental health.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Urban Green Spaces
* Metadata URL: https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/10/12/824
* Data URL: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/percentage-of-total-green-infrastructure#tab-googlechartid_chart_11
* Data Type: CSV

  The percentage of urban area that is covered by green spaces in various cities is measured in this dataset. It provides a thorough picture of the distribution and density of urban vegetation by encompassing the sizes and kinds of green areas.
### Datasource2: Urban Air Quality
* Metadata URL:  https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database/2022
* Data URL: https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/data/air/air-data
* Data Type: CSV
  
This dataset includes comprehensive data on the concentrations of several air pollutants in different cities, including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3. It draws attention to trends in air quality and offers a framework for contrasting pollution levels in relation to the amount of green space.
